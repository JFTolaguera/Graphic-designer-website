        h3 Mock-ups, review and approval cycle
        p I'm a paper guy : I always draw some mockups on my sketchbook first, then design it on my graphic software/code editor, following your specifications. We set off a phase of reviewing, approving, fine tuning the mockup-ups until both you and me are satisfied by the design.</br><span class="soft">Main deliverables : written ideas, rough sketches, documented site map, wireframes, visual mock-ups, some lines of code for the basic design. For websites, I need all of the content provided by the client.</span>

        h3 Development, creation
        p This is typically the main phase. After approval of the mock-ups, I design, code, create all the deliverables, meeting the deadlines. Regularly, I share a progress report and comments about the work. When work is almost finished, this is a time for a full review.
